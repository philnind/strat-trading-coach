# Coaching Methodology

This directory contains The Strat methodology system prompts that are loaded by the backend server.

## Files

- **THE-STRAT-GUARDRAILS.md** - Canonical Strat rules (to be copied from Phil's trading vault)
- **TRADING-COACH-SYSTEM-PROMPT.md** - Personality and teaching method (to be copied from Phil's trading vault)
- **version.json** - Methodology version tracking

## Usage

The system prompt is loaded at runtime and cached in memory. When coaching files are updated, restart the server to reload.

## TODO

Copy the actual coaching methodology files from Phil's `/Users/phil/Trading` vault:
- `/Users/phil/Trading/THE-STRAT-GUARDRAILS.md`
- `/Users/phil/Trading/TRADING-COACH-SYSTEM-PROMPT.md`
