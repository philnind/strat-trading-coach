## CORE STRAT PRINCIPLES

The Strat is built on **three foundational pillars** of equal importance:

1. **Time Frame Continuity** — Trade with the trend across multiple time frames
2. **Broadening Formations** — Recognise exhaustion and reversal patterns
3. **Inside Bars** — Understand consolidation and breakout potential

### Universal Truths

- **Price action is king** — Everything you need is on the chart
- **There are only 3 things that can happen** — Every candle is a 1, 2, or 3
- **Trade what you KNOW to be true** — Not what you hope or speculate
- **The market trades in the direction of the most 2s**
- **Everything is fractal** — Patterns repeat across all time frames

---

## THE THREE CANDLESTICK TYPES

Every candle is classified as a **1, 2, or 3** based on its relationship to the previous candle.

### 1️⃣ INSIDE BAR (1-Candle)

**Definition:** A candle that trades entirely within the previous candle's range (does NOT take out the high OR the low of the previous candle).

**What it means:**
- Equilibrium/balance — neither buyers nor sellers in control
- Price is consolidating
- Represents a pause in the current trend
- **DO NOT TRADE inside bars directly** — wait for them to break

**Key rule:** An inside bar is potential energy waiting to be released. Once the inside bar closes, the next candle that breaks either direction becomes actionable.

---

### 2️⃣ DIRECTIONAL BAR (2-Candle)

**Definition:** A candle that takes out ONE side (high or low) of the previous candle's range.

**Types:**
- **2-up**: Takes out the previous candle's HIGH (but not the low)
- **2-down**: Takes out the previous candle's LOW (but not the high)

**What it means:**
- Directional movement
- Continuation of trend
- **The market trades in the direction of the most 2s**

**Key rule:** A 2-candle can turn into a 3-candle (by wicking up/down and collapsing), but a 2-candle CANNOT turn into a 1-candle.

---

### 3️⃣ OUTSIDE BAR (3-Candle)

**Definition:** A candle that takes out BOTH the high AND the low of the previous candle.

**What it means:**
- Price discovery
- Buyers are willing to buy it up AND sellers are willing to sell it down
- Starts broadening formations
- Expanding volatility

**Key rule:** Outside bars are powerful when they confirm direction, but they also represent uncertainty and increased risk.

---

## FULL TIME FRAME CONTINUITY (FTFC)

**FTFC is the single most important concept in The Strat.**

### Definition

Full Time Frame Continuity exists when **all relevant time frames are aligned in the same direction** (all green/bullish OR all red/bearish).

### Time Frame Combinations

For **swing trading** (your style), check these combinations:
- **Monthly (M) + Weekly (W) + Daily (D)** — Primary combination
- **Weekly (W) + Daily (D) + 4-Hour (4H)** — Secondary combination

For **day trading**, check:
- **Daily (D) + 4-Hour (4H) + 1-Hour (1H)**

### FTFC Requirements

✅ **FTFC UP (Bullish):**
- Monthly = 2-up (or in force to upside)
- Weekly = 2-up (or in force to upside)
- Daily = 2-up (or in force to upside)

✅ **FTFC DOWN (Bearish):**
- Monthly = 2-down (or in force to downside)
- Weekly = 2-down (or in force to downside)
- Daily = 2-down (or in force to downside)

❌ **NO FTFC (Do not trade):**
- Time frames are mixed (some up, some down)
- Any time frame is stuck inside (1-candle) on Thursday or Friday of the week
- Any time frame shows exhaustion risk

### "In Force" Concept

A trigger is **"in force"** when price is currently trading above/below a key level that has already been taken out.

**Example:**
- Weekly 2-up trigger = $100
- Current price = $105
- Status: **Weekly trigger is IN FORCE** (already triggered, still valid)
- Meaning: Any daily setup above $100 is trading WITH the weekly trend

**Critical rule:** If you're entering a setup and the higher time frame trigger is already in force, you have FTFC on your side.

### FTFC Entry Workflow (How to Actually Trade It)

**The Process:**

FTFC isn't just about checking alignment—it's about using **higher timeframes to identify trend direction** and **lower timeframes to find entry points**.

**Step-by-Step Workflow for Swing Trading:**

1. **Check Higher Timeframes for FTFC (M/W/D)**
   - Open Monthly, Weekly, Daily charts
   - Identify candle types: Are they all 2-up OR all 2-down?
   - Check for inside bars (1-candles)—if present on Thursday/Friday, skip
   - ✅ FTFC exists when all three are aligned in the same direction

2. **Drop to Lower Timeframe for Entry (4H or 1H)**
   - Once FTFC is confirmed, switch to 4-Hour or 1-Hour chart
   - Look for pullback/continuation patterns in the direction of FTFC
   - Wait for the lower timeframe to form actionable signals

3. **Identify Entry Pattern on Lower Timeframe**
   - **2-1-2 Continuation:** Price pulls back (inside bar), then continues with FTFC
   - **3-1-2 Continuation:** Outside bar → inside bar → continuation with FTFC
   - **Rev Strat:** Previous 2-down reverses with 2-up (in direction of bullish FTFC)
   - **Hammer/Shooter:** Momentum confirmation candle in direction of FTFC

4. **Execute Entry When Lower TF Triggers**
   - Enter when the lower timeframe candle breaks the trigger level
   - Stop: Opposite side of the pattern
   - Target: Next higher timeframe target level

**Example Scenario (Bullish FTFC):**

- ✅ Monthly: 2-up (bullish)
- ✅ Weekly: 2-up (bullish)
- ✅ Daily: 2-up (bullish)
- **FTFC confirmed—trend direction is UP**

Now drop to 4H chart:
- 4H pulls back and forms a 2-1-2 continuation (2-up → 1 inside → 2-up forming)
- **Entry:** When 4H candle breaks above the inside bar high
- **Stop:** Below the low of the 4H pattern
- **Target:** Next Daily or Weekly resistance level

**Why This Works:**

- Higher timeframes = **Trend direction** (where institutional money is flowing)
- Lower timeframes = **Better entry prices** (enter on pullbacks, not chasing)
- You're trading WITH the trend but entering at optimal levels
- Multiple "participation groups" (daily, weekly, monthly traders) push price your direction

**Key Rules:**

- ❌ Don't trade if higher timeframes are mixed (some up, some down)
- ❌ Don't trade if any higher timeframe is inside on Thursday/Friday
- ❌ Don't enter on the higher timeframe chart—wait for lower TF pullback
- ✅ Always check that your entry pattern moves in the direction of FTFC
- ✅ Higher probability when your lower TF setup also triggers a higher TF actionable signal (domino effect)

**Common Mistake:**

"M/W/D are all bullish, so I'll just buy now!"—NO. Wait for the 4H or 1H to give you a pullback entry. Don't chase. Let price come to you.

## ACTIONABLE SIGNALS (TRADE THESE)

Actionable signals are specific candle combinations that provide **high-probability entry opportunities**.

### 🎯 2-1-2 BULLISH REVERSAL

**Pattern:** 2-down → 1 (inside bar) → 2-up

**Entry:** When the live candle breaks above the high of the inside bar (1-candle)

**Stop:** Below the low of the 2-down candle (the pattern extreme, which contains the inside bar)

**Target:** Previous high, or magnitude target

**When to trade:**
- At the end of a downtrend
- Ideally WITH FTFC (not against it)
- After corrective activity in a broader uptrend

---

**Entry:** When the second 2-candle (2-up) breaks above the high of the first 2-candle (2-down)

**Stop:** Below the low of the 2-down candle

**Target:** Previous swing high, magnitude target

**When to trade:**
- At the end of a downtrend
- Price has reached exhaustion level
- Preferably with FTFC or at a major support level

**CAUTION:** If you're IN a trade and you see a 2-2 reversal AGAINST your position, **EXIT IMMEDIATELY**. This is a reversal signal.

---

### 🎯 2-2 BEARISH REVERSAL

**Pattern:** 2-up → 2-down (consecutive, opposite direction)

**Entry:** When the second 2-candle (2-down) breaks below the low of the first 2-candle (2-up)

**When to trade:**
- At the end of an uptrend
- Price has reached exhaustion level
- Preferably with FTFC or at a major resistance level

---

### 🎯 3-1-2 REVERSAL (Bullish or Bearish)

**Pattern:** 3 (outside bar) → 1 (inside bar) → 2 (in the direction of the reversal)

**Entry:** When the live candle breaks above/below the inside bar (same rules as 2-1-2 reversal)

**Stop:** At the extreme of the 3-candle (for bullish reversal: below the low of the 3-candle; for bearish reversal: above the high of the 3-candle)

**Target:** Previous high/low, magnitude target

**When to trade:**
- After a 3-candle (outside bar) creates volatility

**Entry:** When the 2-up candle breaks above the high of the 2-down candle

**Stop:** Below the low of the 2-down candle

**Target:** High of the inside bar, then next magnitude target

**When to trade:**
- During consolidation periods
- Strong reversal signal after failed breakdown

---

### 🎯 REV STRAT (BEARISH)

**Pattern:** Inside bar → 2-up → 2-down

**Entry:** When the 2-down candle breaks below the low of the 2-up candle

**Stop:** Above the high of the 2-up candle

**Target:** Low of the inside bar, then next magnitude target

**When to trade:**

- Strong reversal signal after failed breakout

---

### 🎯 3-2-2 REVERSAL

**Pattern:** 3 (outside bar) → 2 (one direction) → 2 (opposite direction)

**Entry:** When the second 2-candle breaks the high/low of the first 2-candle

**Stop:** Opposite side of the first 2-candle

**Target:** Previous swing level, magnitude target

**When to trade:**
- After strong volatility (3-candle)
- Clear reversal pattern forming

---

### 🎯 HAMMER / SHOOTER CANDLES

**Hammer (Bullish):**
- Large lower wick, small/no upper wick
- Think: "Hammer building something up"
- **Entry:** When next candle breaks above the top/wick of the hammer

**Shooter/Shooting Star (Bearish):**
- Large upper wick, small/no lower wick
- Think: "Gun shooting something down"
- **Entry:** When next candle breaks below the bottom/wick of the shooter

**Use within patterns:** Hammers and shooters are momentum signals WITHIN larger patterns (e.g., within a 2-1-2 continuation).

**When to trade:**
- Ideally WITH FTFC (trade in direction of higher time frames)
- At major support/resistance levels
- As confirmation within larger actionable signals
- **Avoid trading hammers/shooters alone against FTFC** unless at clear exhaustion levels

---

### 🎯 PIVOT MACHINE GUN (PMG)

**Pattern:** 5+ consecutive 2-candles in the same direction (stacking higher lows or lower highs)

**What it signals:** EXHAUSTION of the current trend - stops stacking up at pivot levels, reversal likely

**Example Bearish PMG:** 2-up, 2-up, 2-up, 2-up, 2-up (5+ consecutive bullish candles making higher lows)

**Example Bullish PMG:** 2-down, 2-down, 2-down, 2-down, 2-down (5+ consecutive bearish candles making lower highs)

**How to trade:**
1. **Identify the PMG** (5+ consecutive 2s stacking pivots)
2. **Wait for reversal pattern** (2-2 reversal: 2-up → 2-down for bearish, or 2-down → 2-up for bullish)
3. **Enter AGAINST the previous momentum** (short after bullish PMG exhausts, long after bearish PMG exhausts)

**Entry:** When the reversal pattern triggers (2-2 reversal confirms)

**Stop:** Opposite side of the reversal candle

**Target:** Back through the pivot levels (extended targets through the PMG range)

**When to trade:**
- After extended trends (5+ days of consecutive 2s)
- Looking for EXHAUSTION and reversal
- High probability at major support/resistance levels
- **This is a counter-trend/reversal setup**, not continuation

---

### 📊 #SSS50PercentRule (Outside Bar Anticipation)

**Concept:** If a candle retraces 50% or more into the previous candle's range, it's likely to become an outside bar (3-candle) by taking out both the high and low.

**CRITICAL:** The 50% level is a **WATCH ZONE**, not a mechanical entry signal. You still need a proper actionable Strat signal to enter.

**How to use:**
- If price goes down 50% into previous candle, this alerts you to WATCH for a potential outside bar formation
- Wait for an actionable signal at the 50% zone (e.g., 2-2 reversal, hammer/shooter, or inside bar breakout)
- **Entry = when the actionable signal triggers** (targeting the previous candle's high to complete the outside bar)

**Example:**
- Previous candle: Low = $100, High = $110
- Current candle opens at $110, drops to $105 (50% retrace) ← **WATCH ZONE**
- Price forms a hammer at $105 (actionable signal)
- Next candle breaks above hammer ← **ENTRY** (targeting $110+ for outside bar completion)

**Use:** This helps you anticipate and watch for outside bar setups, but always combine with an actionable Strat signal for entry.

---

## NON-ACTIONABLE PATTERNS (DO NOT TRADE)

These patterns are **NOT entry signals** on their own:

### ❌ 2-2 Continuations

**Pattern:** 2-up → 2-up OR 2-down → 2-down (same direction)

**Why not actionable:** No specific entry trigger. These represent continuation/momentum, but you need a REVERSAL or INSIDE BAR to provide the entry signal.

**What to do:** Stay in your existing trade if you're already long/short. Do NOT enter fresh trades on these.

---

### ❌ 3-2 or 2-3 Continuations

**Why not actionable:** Same reason as 2-2 continuations — no clear entry trigger.

---

### ❌ Mother Bars

**Definition:** A massive candle followed by smaller candles that all trade within the range of the "mother bar."

**Why not actionable:** Creates choppiness and sideways price action. Price discovery is starting over again. No clear direction.

**Visual:**
```
        │
        │
    │   │   │
  ──┼───┼───┼──  ← All these small candles are inside the big "mother bar"
    │   │   │
        │
    MOTHER BAR
```

**Rule:** Do NOT trade when you see a mother bar forming. Wait for the price to break out of the mother bar's range.

---

## ENTRY RULES

### General Entry Principles

1. **Enter on LIVE candles only** — Never anticipate. Wait for the trigger to be taken out.
2. **The last candle is always live** — In any pattern (2-1-2, 2-2, etc.), the final candle is forming in real-time.
3. **Entry = breakout of previous candle's high/low** — You enter when price breaks the trigger level.
4. **Always use wicks** — If a candle has a wick, your entry/stop uses the wick, not just the body.

### Specific Entry Rules by Pattern

| Pattern | Entry Trigger |
|---------|---------------|
| 2-1-2 Bullish Reversal | Break above the HIGH of the inside bar (1-candle) |
| 2-1-2 Bearish Reversal | Break below the LOW of the inside bar (1-candle) |
| 2-1-2 Bullish Continuation | Break above the HIGH of the inside bar (1-candle) |
| 2-1-2 Bearish Continuation | Break below the LOW of the inside bar (1-candle) |
| 2-2 Bullish Reversal | Break above the HIGH of the 2-down candle with a 2-up |
| 2-2 Bearish Reversal | Break below the LOW of the 2-up candle with a 2-down |
| Rev Strat Bullish | 2-up breaks above the HIGH of the 2-down |
| Rev Strat Bearish | 2-down breaks below the LOW of the 2-up |
| Hammer | Next candle breaks above the top/wick of the hammer |
| Shooter | Next candle breaks below the bottom/wick of the shooter |

### Entry Timing Options

**Option 1: Enter on the trigger candle (same time frame)**
- Enter when the daily candle breaks the daily trigger
- Higher risk, but larger position size possible

**Option 2: Enter on a lower time frame trigger**
- Wait for the daily trigger to be hit
- Drop to 4H or 1H and wait for a lower time frame actionable signal (e.g., 15min 2-1-2)
- Lower risk, tighter stop, but smaller position size

**Best practice:** Use a combination — enter a partial position on the higher time frame trigger, add to the position on lower time frame confirmation.

---

## STOP LOSS RULES

### General Stop Principles

1. **Stops go OPPOSITE your entry**
   - Long entry → Stop below
   - Short entry → Stop above

2. **Use the PATTERN EXTREME for stops (not just the inside bar)**
   - For 2-1-2 patterns: Stop goes at the extreme of the FIRST 2-candle (which contains the inside bar)
   - For 3-1-2 patterns: Stop goes at the extreme of the 3-candle
   - Example: 2-down ($95 low) → 1 (inside bar, $97 low) → 2-up breakout = Stop at $95 (NOT $97)
   - This protects against false breakouts and honors true support/resistance

3. **Always include wicks**
   - If the trigger candle has a wick, your stop goes beyond the wick

4. **Move stops to breakeven ASAP**
   - Once the trade goes in your favour, move your stop to your entry price (breakeven)
   - This eliminates risk

### Specific Stop Rules by Pattern

| Pattern | Stop Placement |
|---------|----------------|
| 2-1-2 Reversal (Long) | Below the LOW of the 2-down candle (pattern extreme, which contains the inside bar) |
| 2-1-2 Reversal (Short) | Above the HIGH of the 2-up candle (pattern extreme, which contains the inside bar) |
| 2-1-2 Continuation (Long) | Below the LOW of the 2-up candle (pattern extreme, which contains the inside bar) |
| 2-1-2 Continuation (Short) | Above the HIGH of the 2-down candle (pattern extreme, which contains the inside bar) |
| 3-1-2 Reversal (Long) | Below the LOW of the 3-candle (pattern extreme) |
| 3-1-2 Reversal (Short) | Above the HIGH of the 3-candle (pattern extreme) |
| 2-2 Reversal (Long) | Below the LOW of the 2-down candle |
| 2-2 Reversal (Short) | Above the HIGH of the 2-up candle |
| Rev Strat (Long) | Below the LOW of the 2-down candle |
| Rev Strat (Short) | Above the HIGH of the 2-up candle |

### Options Trading Stop Rules

For **options**, stop losses are different:

**Option 1: Percentage-based stop**
- Risk 30-40% of the option premium
- Example: Bought option for $2.00 → Stop at $1.20 (40% loss)

**Option 2: Stock-based mental stop**
- Place a mental stop based on the underlying stock price
- If stock hits your stop level, exit the option position
- Example: Entered option when stock was $100, stop at $98 (stock price), exit option regardless of option price

**Best practice:** Use a combination of both — set a maximum loss on the option premium (e.g., 40%), AND a stock-based mental stop.

---

## TARGET SELECTION & MAGNITUDE

**Magnitude** = How far can price reasonably travel?

### Primary Target Selection Methods

1. **Previous high/low (most common)**
   - For a 2-1-2 bullish reversal, target = previous swing high
   - For a 2-1-2 bearish reversal, target = previous swing low

2. **Higher time frame targets**
   - If you're trading a daily setup, check the weekly targets
   - If weekly trigger = $100 and weekly target = $120, your daily setup should target $120

3. **Key levels from the past**
   - Zoom out in time (months, even years)
   - Look for previous highs/lows that price bounced from
   - These become magnets for price movement

4. **Psychological levels**
   - Round numbers ($50, $100, $150, etc.)
   - Price tends to react at these levels
   - Use as secondary targets

5. **Fibonacci retracements**
   - 50% retracement of the previous candle (for outside bars)
   - Extensions for longer-term targets

### Multiple Targets Strategy

**Best practice:** Take profits at multiple levels:

- **25% off at Target 1** (first resistance/support level)
- **50% off at Target 2** (primary magnitude target)
- **25% trailing** (trail stop to the low of each new 2-candle)

**Example:**
- Enter long at $100
- Target 1: $105 (take 25% off)
- Target 2: $110 (take 50% off)
- Target 3: Trail remaining 25% with stops at the low of each new bullish candle

---

## MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS (MTFA)

**MTFA is mandatory for The Strat.**

### The "Big Picture" Approach

**Sara's Method (from Setup Checklist):**

1. **Start with 3 time frames UP from your trading time frame:**
   - If trading Daily → Look at Monthly, Weekly, Daily
   - If trading 4H → Look at Monthly, Weekly, Daily
   - If trading 1H → Look at Weekly, Daily, 4H

2. **Ask yourself:**
   - Does this actionable signal trigger a higher time frame (HTF) actionable signal?
   - Is the HTF in force and does it still have magnitude left?
   - Am I trading WITH FTFC?

3. **The Domino Effect:**
   - You want your lower time frame trigger to set off a CHAIN REACTION
   - Daily setup triggers → Weekly setup triggers → Monthly setup triggers
   - This gives you multiple "participation groups" (daily traders, weekly traders, monthly traders) all pushing price in your direction

### Time Frame Hierarchy

**Higher time frames are more important than lower time frames.**

- A Monthly inside bar is RARE and POWERFUL
- A 1-minute inside bar is COMMON and WEAK

**Rule:** The higher the time frame, the more significant the signal.

---

## SETUP VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before taking ANY trade, answer these questions (from Stratucation Lesson 13):

### ✅ WHY are you taking this trade?

- [ ] **Domino Effect:** Will this actionable signal trigger a HTF actionable signal?
- [ ] **MTFA & Magnitude:** Is the HTF in force and does it still have magnitude left?
- [ ] **TTO (Triangle! They're Out):** Has the chart had corrective activity recently and is setting up an actionable signal back in the direction of FTFC?
- [ ] **FTFC:** Are you trading WITH FTFC? Are surrounding time frames the same colour?

### ⚠️ Or are you trading an exhaustion reversal?

- [ ] **Against FTFC:** Has price reached an exhaustion level and you're attempting a counter-trend exhaustion reversal?
- [ ] **Broadening Formations:** Are you seeing a potential exhaustion reversal at the top or bottom? (Be mindful you're trading counter-trend and be prepared to stop out if it doesn't work)
- [ ] **Trader Style:** Do you even WANT to trade exhaustion reversals against FTFC? (Some traders only play when they have FTFC)

### 🚨 Red Flags (Do NOT trade)

- [ ] **Exhaustion Risk:** Are you trading something on a smaller time frame but the HTF already hit its target and is now at exhaustion risk?
- [ ] **Tightening Ranges:** Are you trading something that is stuck inside on a HTF and unlikely to move?
- [ ] **Late in the week:** Are you trying to trade a daily setup but it's still inside the previous week on a Thursday or Friday?

### 💰 Risk/Reward

- [ ] **R:R Check:** Is the risk/reward worth taking the trade? Is the potential reward bigger than the risk?

---

## WHAT NOT TO TRADE (CRITICAL VIOLATIONS)

These are **automatic disqualifications**. If any of these are present, **DO NOT TRADE**.

### ❌ 1. Trading Inside Bars Directly

**Violation:** Entering a trade while price is still inside an inside bar.

**Why it's wrong:** Inside bars represent equilibrium. You don't know which way it will break.

**Correct approach:** Wait for the inside bar to CLOSE, then enter when the next candle breaks above/below it.

---

### ❌ 2. Trading Against FTFC (Without Clear Exhaustion)

**Violation:** Taking a long trade when Monthly/Weekly/Daily are all bearish (or vice versa).

**Why it's wrong:** You're fighting the trend. Probability of success is LOW.

**Correct approach:** Only trade WITH FTFC. If you MUST trade a counter-trend exhaustion reversal, you need:
- Clear exhaustion signals (broadening formation, multiple rejections at a level)
- Tight stop loss
- Quick profit-taking

**User preference:** You've stated in CLAUDE.md that you want to trade WITH FTFC, not against it. Therefore, this is an absolute violation in your workspace.

---

### ❌ 3. Trading Mother Bars

**Violation:** Entering trades when price is stuck inside a large "mother bar" with multiple smaller candles inside it.

**Why it's wrong:** Creates choppiness. Price discovery is restarting. No clear direction.

**Correct approach:** Wait for price to break out of the mother bar's range, then look for a new actionable signal.

---

### ❌ 4. Trading Tightening Ranges (Late Week Inside Bars)

**Violation:** Taking a daily setup when the weekly candle is still inside the previous week AND it's Thursday or Friday.

**Why it's wrong:** Price is likely to stay stuck inside the week. Not enough time for the weekly to break out.

**Correct approach:** Wait for the new week to start, or trade a lower time frame setup that doesn't depend on the weekly moving.

---

### ❌ 5. Trading at Exhaustion Risk

**Violation:** Taking a bullish daily setup when the weekly has already hit its magnitude target and is now at resistance.

**Why it's wrong:** The higher time frame is exhausted. Your daily setup is likely to fail because there's no more "room to run."

**Correct approach:** Check higher time frame targets BEFORE entering. If HTF is at/near its target, DO NOT TRADE or look for reversal setups instead.

---

### ❌ 6. Entering Without a Trigger Being Taken Out

**Violation:** Anticipating a breakout and entering BEFORE the trigger level is breached.

**Why it's wrong:** The setup hasn't confirmed yet. Price could reverse.

**Correct approach:** Wait for the live candle to break above/below the trigger level, THEN enter.

### ❌ 7. Trading 2-2 Continuations as Entry Signals

**Violation:** Entering a fresh trade on a 2-up → 2-up pattern (or 2-down → 2-down).

**Why it's wrong:** 2-2 continuations are not actionable entry signals. They represent momentum, but there's no clear trigger.

**Correct approach:** If you're ALREADY in a trade, stay in. If you're NOT in a trade, wait for a reversal or inside bar to provide an entry signal.

---

### ❌ 8. Ignoring Higher Time Frame Context

**Violation:** Taking a 15-minute setup without checking the Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.

**Why it's wrong:** You have no idea if you're trading WITH or AGAINST the bigger trend.

**Correct approach:** Always check at least 3 time frames UP from your trading time frame before entering.

---

### ❌ 9. No Stop Loss or Moving Stop Loss Too Early

**Violation:** Entering a trade without a stop, or moving stop to breakeven too early (before the trade has moved in your favour).

**Why it's wrong:** No stop = unlimited risk. Moving stop too early = getting stopped out on normal volatility.

**Correct approach:**
- Always set a stop OPPOSITE your entry
- Move stop to breakeven ONLY after the first target is hit or price has moved significantly in your favour

---

### ❌ 10. FOMO / Overtrading

**Violation:** Taking trades just because "something is moving" without a proper setup.

**Why it's wrong:** No plan = no edge. This is gambling, not trading.

**Correct approach:** Be patient. Wait for clean setups that meet ALL criteria. **No setup, no trade.**

**Sara's wisdom:** "I would rather miss 100 trades than FOMO into 1. When I FOMO, I have no control, no plan, no risk management, and am trading on greed ONLY."

## TRADE MANAGEMENT RULES

### Once You're In a Trade

1. **Move stop to breakeven** as soon as possible
   - After hitting first target, move stop to entry price
   - Now you have ZERO risk

2. **Take partial profits** at each target level
   - 25% at Target 1
   - 50% at Target 2
   - Trail 25% with stops

3. **Trail your stops** on the remaining position
   - For long trades: Move stop to the low of each new bullish 2-candle
   - For short trades: Move stop to the high of each new bearish 2-candle

4. **Exit immediately** if you see a 2-2 reversal AGAINST your position
   - Example: You're long, and you see a 2-up → 2-down (reversal signal) → **EXIT**

5. **Exit if FTFC flips**
   - If you're in a long trade and the weekly goes from 2-up to 2-down → **EXIT**
   - The higher time frame has reversed; your trade is now against FTFC

6. **Don't let winners turn into losers**
   - If your trade goes green and up significantly, don't let it come all the way back and go red
   - Move your stop to at least breakeven

## COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### Mistake 1: "Is the Combo Sheet Hindsight?"

**Misconception:** People think the Strat combo sheet is hindsight because all the candles are shown.

**Truth:** The LAST candle in every pattern is LIVE. It's forming in real-time. That's your entry candle.

**Example:**
- You see a 2-down and a 1 (inside bar) on your chart
- The next candle (2-up) is LIVE and forming RIGHT NOW
- You enter when that live candle breaks above the inside bar high

**Sara's explanation:** "The last two on every little box is live. When we're looking for setups, the day/candle doesn't exist yet. We're asking ourselves in forward-thinking, 'What's the next two?'"

---

### Mistake 2: Overtrading / Lack of Patience

**Problem:** Showing up every day wanting to trade, forcing trades when there are no setups.

**Sara's wisdom:**
- "Last week on $SPY there were only TWO trading days that provided daily actionable signals (reversals). Those days were Wednesday & Friday."
- "If you tried trading Mon, Tues, or Thur you probably got really chopped up."
- "Day Trading is the only job I've ever known where people want to work everyday. This eagerness can hurt you if you don't learn patience."

**Solution:**
- Recognise good trading days vs bad trading days
- Be okay sitting out
- **"You will never lose any money on the sidelines, but you can lose a lot FOMO'ing into an unplanned trade."**

---

### Mistake 3: Over-Complicating

**Problem:** Adding too many indicators, drawing too many lines, analyzing too many stocks.

**Sara's approach:** "When it comes to trading, for me less is more. The fewer tickers I focus on, the better I focus."

**Solution:**
- Stick to The Strat principles
- Focus on price action only
- Keep your watchlist manageable (50-60 stocks max)

---

### Mistake 4: Not Doing Pre-Market Prep

**Problem:** Reacting to the market in real-time without a plan.

**Solution (from Sara's SPY example):**
- Sunday night: Look for 2-1-2 setups on the Daily
- Plan your entry, stop, strike, position size BEFORE the market opens
- Set alerts on TradingView
- When alerts fire → validate setup → execute

**Sara's wisdom:** "Patience = Preparedness! Plan your trade while you are WAITING for the market to finish its corrective activity. Don't get caught off guard when the move finally happens."

---

### Mistake 5: Bad Stop Management

**Problem:** No stop, or moving stop too early/too late.

**Sara's wisdom:** "With good Strat entries, stop losses usually aren't too hard to manage because we expect them to work right away!"

**Solution:**
- Set your stop OPPOSITE your entry (if long, stop below; if short, stop above)
- Move to breakeven after the trade goes in your favour
- Don't let a winner turn into a loser

---

### Mistake 6: Ignoring Risk/Reward

**Problem:** Taking trades where the potential reward is smaller than the risk.

**Solution:**
- Before entering, calculate R:R
- Minimum acceptable R:R = 1:2 (risk $1 to make $2)
- If R:R is poor, SKIP the trade

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST: VALID STRAT TRADE?

Before I recommend or validate ANY trade, I will check ALL of these:

- [ ] **1-2-3 Classification:** Are the candles correctly classified?
- [ ] **FTFC Alignment:** Are M/W/D (or W/D/4H) aligned in the same direction?
- [ ] **Actionable Signal Present:** Is there a valid actionable signal (2-1-2, 2-2 reversal, Rev Strat, etc.)?
- [ ] **Entry Trigger Clear:** Is the entry trigger clearly defined and has it been taken out?
- [ ] **Stop Loss Defined:** Is there a clear stop loss level opposite the entry?
- [ ] **Target Identified:** Is there a clear target with magnitude left to run?
- [ ] **HTF Context Checked:** Have I checked 3 time frames UP for context and FTFC?
- [ ] **No Red Flags:** Are there NO mother bars, tightening ranges, or exhaustion risk present?
- [ ] **Risk/Reward Acceptable:** Is the R:R at least 1:2?
- [ ] **Domino Effect Possible:** Could this setup trigger a higher time frame actionable signal?

**If ANY of these are missing or unclear, the trade is NOT valid per The Strat.**

## CONCLUSION

**These are the rules. This is The Strat.**

If I deviate from these principles, you are authorised to call me out. This document is the canonical source of truth for Strat trading in this workspace.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Only 3 candle types exist:** 1, 2, 3
2. **FTFC is king:** Trade with the trend across multiple time frames
3. **Actionable signals are specific:** 2-1-2 reversals/continuations, 2-2 reversals, Rev Strat, 3-1-2, PMG
4. **Non-actionable patterns exist:** Don't trade 2-2 continuations, mother bars, or tightening ranges
5. **Always use stops:** Opposite your entry, include wicks
6. **Multiple targets:** Take profits in stages
7. **Patience is mandatory:** No setup, no trade

**Rob Smith's thesis:** "Trade only what you know to be true—based on knowledge and experience rather than speculation."
